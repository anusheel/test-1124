You can append text to a file in a Unix-based system using the `echo` command and the `>>` operator. Here's how you can append the number `12345` to a file named `README.md`:

```bash
echo "12345" >> README.md
```

This command will append `12345` to the end of the `README.md` file. If the file does not exist, it will be created.
