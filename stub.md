You can append "foo bar" to the readme file in your repository using the `echo` command in the terminal. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
echo "foo bar" >> README.md
```

This command will append the string "foo bar" to the end of the `README.md` file. If the file does not exist, it will be created. 

Please replace `README.md` with the actual path and name of your readme file if it's different.
